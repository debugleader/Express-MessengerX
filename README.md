# MessengerX

MessengerX is a **web application** used for instant _messaging_ and for _group chats_.

# Why?

Over 3 billion people use messaging apps on a regular basis to communicate with friends and businesses, and messaging is the most preferred channel for customer service in the U.S, therefore I decided to learn how to use web sockets to implement them and create this application.

# How?

It uses a *register* form and a *login* system to authorize and authenticate users that are linked to a *database*, then it allows them to join specific *group chats* to communicate instantly!

> This application was initially built by Brad Traversy in this [tutorial](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jD7FnbI76Hg), I simply improved the application and added a login system, security, some styling, and more functionalities.
